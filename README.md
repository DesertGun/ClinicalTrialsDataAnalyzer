## Summary

### ClinicalTrialsDataAnalyzer is a webapp which I developed for my bachelor thesis. The aim was to extract, consolidate and aggregate data from ClinicalTrials.gov in order to provide better information to clinicians or clinical trial designers about which parameters are best to choose for each clinical trial.
