# ClinicalTrialsDataAnalyzer
Bachelorâ€™s Thesis - Web-App 

## Summary

### ClinicalTrialsDataAnalyzer is a webapp which I developed for my bachelor thesis. The aim was to extract, consolidate and aggregate data from ClinicalTrials.gov in order to provide better information to clinicians or clinical trial designers about which parameters are best to choose for each clinical trial. 

## Folder structure

'.\backend' for flasks-server and NER-processing
'.\frontend' for nuxt.js files
'.\training' for training data, model and the ipython-notebook for spacy training

## Installation

1) Download and extract the package provided on the repository, tagged 1.0.
2) Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)/[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution
3) Install revelant python dependancies via the console: 'pip install flask flask-cors spacy spacy-annotator' 
4) Download relevant model for [spacy](https://spacy.io/) (for further custom training) with 'python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm'
5) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
6) Navigate to /frontend/ and install all needed dependancies via 'npm install'
7) After the installation run 'npm audit fix' if vulnerabilities are shown

## Launching the App in Dev-Mode

1) Navigate to /backend/ and start the server with 'flask run'
2) Navigate to /frontend/ and start the node-server with 'npm run dev'
3) Open localhost:3000 on your browser and use the app

## Hosting for production

1) For the flask - server follow the following instructions from the [official-doc](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/deploy/)
2) For Nuxt buid the frontend with 'npm run build' and then start with 'npm run start' to deply the server-side version of the frontend

## Disclamer

The data used in this software is publicly available and has been provided by the following providers: 

1) [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) via their [API](https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/gui)
2) Clinical Tirals Transformation Initiative([CTTI](https://ctti-clinicaltrials.org/)) for the [AACT-database](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/)
